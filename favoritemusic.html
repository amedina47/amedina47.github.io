         <h2>My Favorite Music</h2>
         <p>I enjoy a wide variety of different music genres. A couple of my favorite genres, however, would be: indie rock, neopsychedelic, and dream pop. For each of these genres, I'll list some of my favorite music artists.</p>
         <h3>Dream Pop</h3>
         <p>My favorite dream pop artist is Cuco. He is Mexican-American and is from Hawthorne, California. His music means a lot to me as a Mexican-American. I find his music to be very original and listening to his music always puts me in a good mood. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKaMuLIvUPc">Here</a> is the link to my favorite song by him.</p>
         <h3>Neopsychedelic</h3>
         <p>This genre is the one that contains my favorite band, Tame Impala. Run by one person, Kevin Parker, their songs and lyrics mean a lot to me. <a href= "https://youtu.be/H3E08gd1KIU">This</a> is my favorite song by them (although every song is amazing and it's a bit hard to chose a favorite).</p>
         <h3>Indie Rock</h3> 
         <p>Indie rock is my true inner hipster coming out. One of my favorite indie rock artists is Mac DeMarco, and I recently saw him live at Tropicalia Music Festival. <a href= "https://youtu.be/MeRIAew8eXc">This</a> is my favorite feel-good song by him.</p>
